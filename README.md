# My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This project showcases my skills, projects, and professional background built with Next.js.

## 🚀 About

This portfolio is a Next.js application that serves as my public profile and project showcase. It is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to maintain.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `/src/app` - Next.js pages, layouts and components
- `/public` - Static assets like images and resume

The `/docs` folder contains the static build of the portfolio, generated by running:
Also added `.nojekyll` file under `/docs` to prevent resource issues for github pages.

npm run build
